# Iris Data Cleaning

main.py contains the code that imports the original data set, cleans it, and then exports it. Iris_dataset_cleaned.csv contains the clean version of the data.

Numbers that could not be inferred/converted for values (such as the dates) were made into None values, meaning fully blank in the .csv file.
